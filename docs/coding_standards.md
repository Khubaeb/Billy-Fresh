# Coding Standards

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for the Logicstudio clone project. Following these standards ensures code consistency, maintainability, and quality across the project.

## PHP Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

1. **PSR-2/PSR-12 Compliance**
   - Follow [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards
   - Use Laravel Pint for code style enforcement

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - **Classes**: PascalCase (`UserController`, `InvoiceService`)
   - **Methods/Functions**: camelCase (`getUserInfo()`, `calculateTotal()`)
   - **Variables**: camelCase (`$userCount`, `$invoiceTotal`)
   - **Constants**: UPPER_CASE with underscores (`MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`)
   - **Properties**: camelCase (`$this->totalAmount`)

3. **File Organization**
   - One class per file
   - Follow Laravel's directory structure
   - Group related functionality in namespaces

4. **Comments and Documentation**
   - Use PHPDoc for classes, methods, and properties
   - Comment complex logic and business rules
   - Keep comments up to date with code changes

### Laravel-Specific Standards

1. **Routes**
   - Group routes by functionality
   - Use route names for all routes
   - Use resource routes when appropriate
   - Keep route files organized and readable

2. **Controllers**
   - Follow single responsibility principle
   - Keep methods small and focused
   - Use resource controllers when appropriate
   - Move business logic to services/repositories

3. **Models**
   - Define relationships clearly
   - Use model scopes for query conditions
   - Keep model methods focused on data manipulation
   - Add proper PHPDoc for relationships

4. **Validation**
   - Use Form Request classes for complex validation
   - Keep validation rules in a single place
   - Create custom validation rules when needed

5. **Database**
   - Use migrations for all database changes
   - Document complex migrations
   - Use seeders for test/demo data
   - Define foreign keys and indexes explicitly

6. **Blade Templates**
   - Keep templates clean and minimal
   - Use components and partials for reusable UI
   - Minimize logic in templates
   - Use proper indentation for nested elements

## JavaScript Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

1. **Formatting**
   - Use 2 space indentation
   - Use semicolons to terminate statements
   - Limit line length to 100 characters
   - Use meaningful variable and function names

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (`getUserData()`, `totalAmount`)
   - **Constants**: UPPER_CASE (`MAX_ITEMS`) or PascalCase for imported constants
   - **Classes/Constructors**: PascalCase (`CustomerForm`)
   - **DOM IDs**: kebab-case (`customer-form`, `invoice-table`)

3. **Best Practices**
   - Prefer `const` over `let`, use `var` only when necessary
   - Use arrow functions for callbacks
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Use meaningful comments for complex logic

### Bootstrap and jQuery

1. **Component Initialization**
   - Document component initialization
   - Centralize initialization code
   - Use data attributes for configuration when possible

2. **Event Handling**
   - Use delegated events when appropriate
   - Keep event handlers small and focused
   - Consider using custom events for complex interactions

3. **DOM Manipulation**
   - Minimize direct DOM manipulation
   - Cache jQuery selectors when used multiple times
   - Use Bootstrap's JavaScript API when available

## HTML/CSS Standards

### HTML

1. **Structure**
   - Use semantic HTML elements (`header`, `nav`, `section`, etc.)
   - Keep proper indentation for nested elements
   - Use HTML5 doctype
   - Include appropriate meta tags

2. **Accessibility**
   - Use proper ARIA attributes
   - Ensure proper contrast for text
   - Use appropriate alt text for images
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works

3. **Forms**
   - Label all form controls properly
   - Group related form elements with fieldset
   - Use appropriate input types
   - Provide clear validation feedback

### CSS/Bootstrap

1. **Organization**
   - Use Bootstrap classes whenever possible
   - Custom CSS should be minimal and purposeful
   - Group related styles together
   - Use proper class naming conventions

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use descriptive class names
   - Follow BEM methodology for custom classes
   - Avoid overly specific selectors
   - Avoid inline styles

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Design mobile-first
   - Use Bootstrap's responsive utilities
   - Test designs at different breakpoints
   - Ensure proper display on various devices

## Git Workflow Standards

1. **Branching**
   - Follow the Git workflow defined in the deployment guide
   - Use descriptive branch names (`feature/customer-filtering`)
   - Keep branches focused on a single feature or fix

2. **Commits**
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Keep commits focused and atomic
   - Reference issue/ticket numbers in commit messages

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Provide clear descriptions
   - Reference related issues
   - Keep PRs reasonably sized for effective review
   - Address review comments promptly

4. **Code Reviews**
   - Review for functionality, design, and style
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Look for security and performance issues
   - Ensure tests are included when appropriate

## Testing Standards

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for all business logic
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

2. **Feature Tests**
   - Test key user flows
   - Cover happy paths and error cases
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Mock external dependencies

3. **Browser Tests**
   - Test critical UI interactions
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Test across different browsers when possible

## Security Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user input

   - Implement request throttling for sensitive endpoints

2. **Authentication/Authorization**
   - Follow Laravel's authentication best practices
   - Use middleware for authorization

   - Use CSRF protection for all forms

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Be careful with debug information in production
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use HTTPS for all communications

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database**
   - Index frequently queried columns
   - Optimize complex queries
   - Use eager loading to avoid N+1 problems
   - Implement caching for expensive queries

2. **Frontend**
