# Implementation Plan for Logicstudio System Clone

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing a clone of the Logicstudio system using Laravel and Bootstrap.

## 1. Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Laravel 10+ (PHP 8.1+)
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+
- **Authentication**: Laravel's built-in authentication with custom role management
- **File Storage**: Local server storage using Laravel's filesystem
- **PDF Generation**: Laravel Dompdf for PDF exports
- **Email**: Laravel Mail with SMTP configuration
- **Localization**: English as primary language, with infrastructure for adding more languages later

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Bootstrap 5
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with optional jQuery for DOM manipulation
- **Form Validation**: Bootstrap validation + server-side validation
- **Data Tables**: Bootstrap Tables or DataTables.js
- **Charts**: Chart.js for data visualization
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons or Font Awesome

## 2. System Architecture

The system architecture uses local services and storage:

```
Client Browser → Laravel Application → Bootstrap Frontend
                                     → Business Logic
                                     → Database Layer
                                     → Local Services (Storage, Mail, PDF)
                                     → MySQL Database
```
