## 13. Accounting Portal Implementation

After reviewing the original system, we've implemented an Accounting Portal focused on report generation and data exports for accountants. This approach matches how the original system operated as an interface for accountants rather than implementing a full double-entry bookkeeping system.

### Components Implemented

   - Export data in various formats (PDF, CSV, uniform structure)
   - Generate reports for different date ranges and periods
   - Track export history

2. **Accounting Reports**
   - Income Statements
   - Account Cards
   - VAT Payments
   - Profit & Loss 
   - Advanced Payments
   - Centralized Card

3. **Accounting Settings**
   - Configure accounting office information
   - Set export preferences
   - Manage auto-export options

4. **Accounting Documents**
   - Track documents needed for accounting
   - Organize files by categories

### Database Schema

New tables added to support the Accounting Portal:
- accounting_exports (track export jobs and history)
- accounting_settings (configure accounting integration)
- export_templates (save report templates)
- accounting_documents (manage accounting-related files)

### Controller & Routes

A dedicated controller and route file have been created for the Accounting Portal:
- AccountingPortalController (manages all accounting-related functionality)
- routes/accounting.php (defines all accounting portal routes)
   - Role-based middleware protection through custom CheckRole middleware
   - Restricted access to Administrator and Accountant roles
   - Added proper route-level authorization
   - Conditional navigation menu display based on user roles

### UI Implementation

The main accounting portal interface has been implemented with:
- Dashboard showing accounting office information
- Quick access to report exports
- Links to various accounting reports
- Income statement preview
